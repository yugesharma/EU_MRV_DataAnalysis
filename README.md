## Detail
â€‹The project involved data cleaning, and calculating various figures to obtain a wide view on the CO2 emission and fuel consumption in terms of the ship types and the ports of registry involved.
I used SQL server to carry out the queries. The data was then exported to Excel sheets and create an interactive dashboard of visualizations on Tableau Public.

From the analysis, it can be seen that although passenger ships emit less CO2 per nautical mile, they rank the highest among all ship types in the category of total CO2 emitted. The ports of registry from China contribute the largest in fuel consumption.
